### remember that threads in one direction will have same global ids(say x direction then
in every blocks threads in x direction will have same indicies like 0,1,2,3..)

### blockidx.x controls the row movement of the threads in x direction
in more simple langauge the threads in x direction moves along the rows due to blockidx.x
if it swapes then they move along the column direction 

### in warps threads are stored with consecutive threadIdx.x as threadIdx.y managing rows
and threads are given linear id -> x + y*blockdim.x where threadIdx.x -> x and threadIdx.y ->y
