## CUDA Learning - Day 10

### Implemented Naive Convolution

- **Goal**: Implement a simple 2D convolution operation using CUDA with a naive approach before optimizing it further.
  
- **Approach**:
  - Implemented a CUDA kernel for performing convolution on an input matrix with a fixed-size kernel.
  - Used `threadIdx.x` and `threadIdx.y` for computing the corresponding row and column indices.
  - Iterated over the kernel dimensions within each thread to compute the convolution sum.
  - Stored the final computed value in the output matrix.
  
### Key Details:

- **Thread Indexing**:
  - Used a **2D thread grid** where each thread corresponds to an output matrix position.
  - Corrected memory indexing issues to ensure each thread accesses the appropriate input data.

- **Boundary Handling**:
  - Ensured that threads outside valid convolution range do not perform computations.
  - Used proper boundary checks `(row < r - k + 1 && col < c - k + 1)`.
  
- **Synchronization**:
  - Initially used `__syncthreads()`, but removed it as it was unnecessary since each thread computes an independent output.
  
### To Do / Next Steps:

- **Optimization**:
  - **Use Shared Memory**: Implement shared memory to store tiles of the input matrix, reducing redundant global memory accesses.
  - **Tiled Convolution**: Load matrix blocks into shared memory and compute partial convolutions efficiently.
  - **Memory Coalescing**: Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
  - **Block Size Experimentation**: Test different block sizes to balance parallelism and shared memory usage.

- **Further Enhancements**:
  - **Thread Utilization**: Improve how threads load and compute values to minimize idle threads.
  - **Optimization Techniques**: Investigate register optimizations and loop unrolling to further enhance performance.
  - **Edge Case Handling**: Ensure proper handling of non-divisible matrix dimensions and edge padding strategies.
  
### Challenges:
- Ensuring correct computation of convolution output while maintaining efficient memory access.
- Properly handling kernel indexing to prevent incorrect memory accesses.
- Balancing computation load across threads while optimizing for memory bandwidth.
