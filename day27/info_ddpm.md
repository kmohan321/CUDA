# 🚀 CUDA Implementation of DDPM Denoising

## 📅 Date: February 22, 2025

## 🔥 Summary
Today, we implemented **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)** in CUDA. The key focus was on **parallelizing the denoising step** to efficiently reverse the diffusion process using a custom CUDA kernel.

## 🎯 Key Implementations
### 1️⃣ **Parallelized DDPM Denoising Kernel**
- Implemented the **DDPM denoising formula** as a CUDA kernel.
- Used **shared memory** to optimize memory access.
- Handled **(C, H, W) image format**, using **Z-dimension for channels**.
- Added support for **optional stochastic noise** during sampling.

### 2️⃣ **Noise Corruption Visualization**
- Proposed a **visualization approach** where an initial structured image (e.g., a circle or smiley face) is **gradually corrupted with noise**.
- This helps to visually demonstrate the diffusion process.

### 3️⃣ **Forward and Reverse Process**
#### 🔹 **Forward Process (Diffusion)**
- A clean image is gradually **corrupted** by adding Gaussian noise at each timestep.
- This results in a distribution that eventually becomes pure noise.
- The noise follows a schedule controlled by **alpha coefficients**.

#### 🔹 **Reverse Process (Denoising)**
- The model learns to **remove noise step by step** using a trained network.
- Given a noisy image at time **t**, the model estimates the noise and reconstructs the previous timestep.
- This process repeats iteratively, refining the image back to its original state.

### 4️⃣ **Future Work**
- **Parallelizing the entire sampling process** instead of just one timestep.
- **Batch-wise denoising** for multiple images.
- **Visual comparison of DDPM vs DDIM** denoising.

## 📌 Learnings
✅ **Parallelizing diffusion models is highly efficient** 🚀
✅ **Shared memory helps optimize large image processing tasks**
✅ **CUDA accelerates DDPM denoising compared to standard PyTorch implementations**

## 🎯 Next Steps
- 🔹 **Fully parallelize DDPM sampling** (entire diffusion process)
- 🔹 **Train and test with a real neural network**
- 🔹 **Benchmark performance vs PyTorch-based diffusion models**
- 🔹 **Enhance visualization of diffusion vs denoising process**

💡 **Conclusion**: Today’s work sets the foundation for **fast diffusion-based image generation** using CUDA! 💙🔥
