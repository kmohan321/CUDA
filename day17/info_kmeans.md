## CUDA Learning - Day 17

### Implemented K-Means Clustering in CUDA

- **Goal**: Implement the **K-Means clustering algorithm** in CUDA for efficient large-scale clustering.
- **Algorithm Overview**:
  
  1. **Initialize** cluster centroids randomly.
  2. **Assign** each point to the nearest centroid.
  3. **Update** centroids based on assigned points.
  4. **Repeat** until convergence or max iterations.

### **Implementation Details**
- **Approach**:
  - Used **parallel reduction** to efficiently compute distances.
  - Assigned **each data point to the nearest cluster** in parallel.
  - Updated **centroids** by computing mean of assigned points.
- **Grid and Block Configuration**:
  - **Threads per block** process individual data points.
  - **Shared memory** used for storing intermediate sums.
  
### **Performance Optimization**
- **Efficient Distance Computation**:
  - Used **Euclidean distance** for cluster assignment.
  - Optimized memory access for **coalesced reads**.
- **Cluster Centroid Update**:
  - Used **atomic operations** to accumulate point sums.
  - Reduced **warp divergence** by optimizing index computations.

### **Challenges Faced**
- Handling **large datasets efficiently** in GPU memory.
- Managing **atomic operations** for centroid updates.
- Ensuring **convergence within a reasonable number of iterations**.

### **Key Observations**
- **Memory Access**:
  - Used **shared memory** to store intermediate centroid calculations.
  - Reduced **global memory accesses** by optimizing thread workloads.
- **Scalability**:
  - Performance improved significantly for **high-dimensional data**.
  - Optimized for **batch-wise processing** using multi-stream execution.

### **Next Steps**
- **Benchmark CUDA implementation** against CPU-based K-Means.
- Implement **Mini-Batch K-Means** for streaming data.
- Explore **further optimizations** using hierarchical clustering techniques.
