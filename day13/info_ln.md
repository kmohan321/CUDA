## CUDA Learning - Day 13

### Implemented Optimized Layer Normalization

- **Goal**: Implement an efficient Layer Normalization function using CUDA that performs well for large feature dimensions.
  
- **Approach**:
  - Designed a CUDA kernel where **each block processes one row** (batch instance) for efficient parallel execution.
  - Implemented **parallel reduction** to compute `mean(x)` and `variance(x)` efficiently.
  - Optimized memory access by using **shared memory** for intermediate sum calculations.
  - Used **CUDA events** to measure precise kernel execution time.
  
### Key Details:

- **Thread Indexing & Parallel Computation**:
  - Each thread handles **multiple elements** using `stride-based` access.
  - Used **parallel reduction** within shared memory for computing both **mean** and **variance**.
  
- **Parallel Reduction Optimization**:
  - **Step 1**: Each thread computes its partial sum of `x` and stores it in shared memory.
  - **Step 2**: Performs **block-wide reduction** to compute the final `mean(x)`.
  - **Step 3**: Each thread computes `(x - mean)^2`, then reduces again to obtain `variance(x)`.
  - **Step 4**: Normalizes `x` using computed statistics and applies **gamma and beta scaling**.
  
- **Memory Optimization**:
  - Used **shared memory** to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
  - Avoided bank conflicts by properly indexing shared memory usage.
  - **Reduced synchronization overhead** by optimizing the reduction process.
  

### Results:
- **GPU Time (CUDA Event Timing)**: `0.465 ms`
- **CPU Time**: `43.000 ms`
- **Max Error**: `1.744817` (Indicating potential floating-point precision issues)
  
### To Do / Next Steps:

- **Improve Numerical Stability**:
  - Use **double precision** for intermediate summations.
  - Implement **Kahan summation** to reduce floating-point errors.
  - Optimize the variance calculation for better precision.
  
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Implement **warp-level reductions (`__shfl_down_sync()`)** for faster reductions.
  - Tune **block and grid sizes** for further performance gains.
  
- **Next Component**:
  - Implement **Forward + Backpropagation** for Linear Layer in CUDA as part of the neural network pipeline.
  
### Challenges Faced:
- Handling **large feature dimensions (`FEATURE_DIM = 65536`)** efficiently.
- Debugging precision errors leading to high `max_error`.
- Optimizing **parallel reduction** while minimizing synchronization overhead.
